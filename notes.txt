                            I am a computer science student with a keen interest in design and creating visually engaging UI experiences. I have a passion for developing software that not only functions well but also captures the user's attention with its aesthetics. I love to experiment different color schemes, fonts, and layouts to find the perfect combination that makes an application or website pop.

                           As someone who has always participated in science fairs, I have a natural curiosity about how things work and an eagerness to share my knowledge with others. I enjoy exploring new ideas and finding innovative solutions to problems, and I love to apply this same mindset to your programming projects.
